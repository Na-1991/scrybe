It’s personal, slow, and it involves more than one person.<br/>You may need to convince a CEO, a finance team, and a tech manager. Therefore, your content must speak to each role. Also, don’t expect quick wins. It often takes months to close a deal. You need to stay visible, helpful, and relevant the whole time."},

LinkedIn is where most B2B action happens.<br/>The UAE alone has 9.7 million LinkedIn users. That’s over 90% of the population.<br/>Your brand should be there. Share useful posts, and make sure you write in English and Arabic. Arabic posts get up to 50% more engagement.<br/>Keep it real. Skip the slick promo videos. Try short explainers, product tips, or webinar clips. Usually videos that are under 3 minutes, easy to follow, and helpful do the best in this context."},

Follow up with a short video. <br/>Later, share a case study. Keep showing how you solve their problem. Mention their name, country, and industry. Show them this isn’t a bulk message. It’s personalized for them.<br/>And when they’re ready, have someone real reach out. No bots, no pressure. Just a person."

        {"title":"What We Saw in the Market","description":"Every week, we saw brands push out content meant for Gulf buyers. The message was off. It sounded like it came from a machine, or a non-native speaker. Or worse, from far outside the region.<br/>The Arabic was stiff, the English was cluttered, and the voice didn’t fit.<br/>Audiences noticed. They stopped reading, or they stopped trusting.<br/>In a region where trust drives business, poor content does more than fall flat. It drives people away.<br/>"},
        {"title":"Why Translation Alone Doesn’t Work","description":"Many brands try to fix this by translating content from English into Arabic. But direct translation doesn’t work.<br/><ul>Here’s why:<li>• Arabic isn’t one-size-fits-all.</li><li>• Arabic isn’t one-size-fits-all.</li><li>• What works in Saudi may not fit the UAE.</li><li>• Word-for-word translation misses tone, nuance, and culture.</li></ul><br/>Machines can’t solve this.

We’ve spent over 15 years working with Arabic and English content. We know how to write for people, not platforms.<br/>We don’t just check for grammar. We check for voice, flow, and fit. We localize, adapt, and make sure the message sounds like it came from the region, not through it.<br/>And we don’t act like outsiders. We work as an extension of your team."},
        {"title":"What Makes Content Work in the Gulf","description":"To win in the GCC, your content has to do three things:<br/><b>1.Sound local. </b>People should feel like you understand the market, because you do.<br/><b>2. Be clear. </b>Whether in Arabic or English, good writing is easy to read and hard to ignore.<br/><b>3. Build trust. </b>That comes from relevance, tone, and consistency. It’s what separates noise from value.<br/>Many Gulf brands try to scale fast, and their content suffers. They rush to publish without checking how it lands in Arabic. Or they go global without thinking local.<br/>The result? Messaging that confuses more than it converts.<br/>We help you avoid that.<br/>"},
        {"title":"Why Voice, Tone, and Trust Matter","description":"A strong B2B content strategy in the GCC starts with voice. Not just what you say, but how you say it.<br/>Do you sound confident? Respectful? Clear?<br/>Are you writing for Saudi execs or UAE startups? Are you casual or formal? Bilingual or Arabic-first?<br/>Tone and delivery make all the difference. This isn’t just translation. It’s content localization, and it matters more than ever.<br/>"},
        {"title":"What GCC Brands Deserve","description":"You deserve more than fast translation.<br/>You deserve content that fits your brand, and your market.<br/>You deserve a partner who gets the details right.<br/>We’ve worked with governments, global firms, and startups. The common thread? Once you get the voice right, everything else falls into place, outreach, leads, deals, and growth.<br/>Because in the Gulf, trust starts with language. And trust builds business."},
        {"title":"Why We Started Scrybe","description":"We started Scrybe because we believe this:<br/>• Content should be simple, sharp, and human.<br/>• Arabic should feel like a first language, not a second thought.<br/>• Good writing doesn’t draw attention to itself, it just works.<br/>• GCC brands should never settle for “good enough.”<br/>If you’re ready to sound more like you, and more like here, let’s talk. <a href='https://www.scrybe.ae/contact/'>Contact Us.</a>"}
