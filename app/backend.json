      "content": "<p>Doing B2B marketing in the Gulf takes more than global strategy. It takes local understanding.Buyers in the GCC don’t move fast. They don’t buy from strangers. They need to trust you. They need to see value. That means your content must speak clearly, feel local, and work at every step.Here’s how to build a B2B content strategy that works across the Gulf.</p><span><b>Why GCC Buyers Need a Different Approach</b><p>In the GCC, most B2B deals start with relationships. People buy from people they trust. It’s personal, slow, and it involves more than one person.You may need to convince a CEO, a finance team, and a tech manager. Therefore, your content must speak to each role. Also, don’t expect quick wins. It often takes months to close a deal. You need to stay visible, helpful, and relevant the whole time.</p></span><span><b>Where to Reach B2B Audiences in the Gulf</b><p>GCC buyers are online, a lot. Internet use in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar is near 100%. LinkedIn is where most B2B action happens.The UAE alone has 9.7 million LinkedIn users. That’s over 90% of the population.Your brand should be there. Share useful posts, and make sure you write in English and Arabic. Arabic posts get up to 50% more engagement.Keep it real. Skip the slick promo videos.Try short explainers, product tips, or webinar clips. Usually videos that are under 3 minutes, easy to follow, and helpful do the best in this context.</p></span>",
